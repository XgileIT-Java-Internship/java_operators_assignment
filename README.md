Java has the following conditional statements:
Use IF to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use ELSE to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use ELSE IF to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use SWITCH to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
